# PowerVQE: An Open Framework for Quality Enhancement of Compressed Video

We implement some widely-used quality enhancement approaches for compressed videos based on the powerful [MMEditing](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting) project. These approaches are commonly used as compared approaches in this field.

- [STDF (AAAI 2020)](https://github.com/ryanxingql/stdf-pytorch): Enhancing compressed videos with feature-wise deformable convolutions, instead of frame-wise motion estimation and compensation.
- [MFQEv2 (TPAMI 2019)](https://github.com/ryanxingql/mfqev2.0): Enhancing frames in compressed videos taking advantage of neighboring good-quality frames.
- [DCAD (DCC 2017)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7923714/): The first approach to post-process the decoded videos with deep-learning method. It also sets up good experimental settings.
- [DnCNN (TIP 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03981): Widely used for decompression and denoising.

Codes will be released in a few weeks.
